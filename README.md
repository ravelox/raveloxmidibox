# raveloxmidibox
A self-contained MIDI controller using a Raspberry Pi and raveloxmidi

This is intended to be a set of scripts and programs to use a Raspberry Pi as the CPU for
a 8-button ( with the option for expansion ) MIDI controller.

To be done:

Scripts, STL files, BOM and config UI.

This software is released under GPLv3

Note: After some testing, using a Pi Zero W introduces too much latency to poll for button presses and send the data at the same time.
